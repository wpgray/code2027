I included the file needed to install opencv on a windows 64 bit machine using Python 3.5.

In order to do this, open up Command Prompt. CD into this directory (opencv_install).

Type out the following on Command Prompt:

pip install opencv_python-3.1.0-cp35-none-win_amd64.whl

This will setup opencv on the machine. To install it on the robot, follow the details on the github page
we found the other day. However, even with opencv installed, Pycharm may not recognize it and it will say
that it cannot find the module but it will work.

To test this out, I included CVTest.py. To run this, open this project in Pycharm, open CVTest.py. Run>Run>CVTest

Enjoy the image :)

Once you are done you can delete opencv_install folder.

As of now, my Vision.py just displays the test.png image I have and when you click on the image, it will create
a mask selecting the pixels of similar color.
